## Summary
I a continuation from my previous [Python API Challenge]( https://github.com/carmelamonis/python-api-challenge), I took the visualizations that were generated to build a dashboard. The dashboard will contain  a landing page, comparisons page, data page, and four visualization pages. The main goal is to utilize Bootstrap to create a web page.

## Scope

Each visualization page will contain a plot with an explanation for that plot. 

I used Bootstrap to create the dashboard, and made the header allow a dropdown for the user to select their preferred plot. The dashboard was also made responsive so that as the width of window becomes smaller, the navigation bar will change, along with the layout of data and visualizations.

This can be deployed using the link: [https://carmelamonis.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/index.html]( https://carmelamonis.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/index.html)
